## Current step

**Step 8.3 — real-case dry-run (in progress, 2026-04-27)**

Branch: `feature/step-8-3-real-case-dry-run`. Plan:
`/Users/talwarpulkit/.claude/plans/before-we-go-into-foamy-mccarthy.md`.

## Why now

The roster is complete (5 SDLC + 16 BCG agents, 17 skills + 3 new from
upstream, 6 workflows, generic context, BCG adapter content) and the
install path is current and Python-driven. 8.3 exercises the stack
against a real consulting workflow (pure consulting case, real-but-
redacted briefing) to surface gaps the unit-level smoke tests can't,
and adds the onboarding + write-protection + propagation-capture
scaffolding that was missing.

## Stage plan

- **Stage 1** — branch + WORKSPACE update (in progress)
- **Stage 2** — build the kit on fork (8 atomic commits):
  - 2a. `skill_evolution_mode` config flag (Philosophy C, in_place default)
  - 2b. Slim 6-path install-side write protection (native `permissions.deny`)
  - 2c. `client-onboarding` skill
  - 2d. `document-researcher` skill
  - 2e. `INDEX.md` template + extend client `_template/`
  - 2f. CLAUDE.md conditional-mount lazy-load fix
  - 2g. `propose-harness-fix.py` capture tool
  - 2h. `snapshot_diff.py` + post_install snapshot hook
- **Stage 3** — install + onboard new tracked target at
  `~/code/case-dryrun-<slug>/` (own git repo). Real-but-redacted briefing
  dropped into `raw-uploads/`. Drive `client-onboarding` end-to-end.
- **Stage 4** — run pure-consulting workflow end-to-end through BCG
  pipeline. Save transcript to `examples/dry-runs/8-3-<slug>.md`.
- **Stage 5** — capture (`snapshot_diff.py --diff`), gap log at
  `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-04-27-step-8-3-gap-log.md`, fix-and-
  reinstall loop on blockers, defer non-blockers to 8.4, graduate
  durable lessons.

## Locked decisions (input to plan)

- **Skill evolution**: Philosophy C hybrid; `skill_evolution_mode: "in_place"` default, `propose_only` opt-in.
- **Read-only set in installs (slim, 6 paths)**: `CLAUDE.md`, `.claude/settings.json`, `.claude/agents/**`, `.agent/protocols/permissions.md`, `.agent/harness/**`, `.agent/AGENTS.md`. Skills + memory + agent-memory stay writable (preserves skillforge + per-skill self-rewrite + dream cycle).
- **Cross-install propagation**: instrument capture in 8.3; `harness-graduate.py` deferred to 8.4; `install.sh --upgrade` deferred to 8.5.
- **Target**: new tracked git project at `~/code/case-dryrun-<slug>/`.
- **Case scope**: pure consulting (situation assessment → issue tree → recommendation deck).
- **Briefing**: user-supplied real-but-redacted, into `<target>/.agent/memory/client/<slug>/raw-uploads/`.
- **Onboarding kit**: full (both new skills + INDEX pattern + lazy-load fix + propose-harness-fix + snapshot/diff).

## Recurring cadence

- Weekly upstream sync check: every Monday morning. Mechanism:
  `CronCreate` (durable, 7-day TTL, ID `ba87d58c`, fires Mon 9:13 local)
  re-armed each fire, plus auto-memory entry `upstream_sync_cadence.md`
  so the cadence survives session restarts beyond the cron's lifetime.

## Recent upstream-sync checks

- 2026-04-27 — base WAS v0.8.0 (`a397568`); 59 commits behind across 6
  tags through v0.11.2. Merged via Step 8.2.5. Base now v0.11.2 + 8.x
  + BCG harness_manager port. Two upstream regressions discovered &
  fixed locally (cli.py future import, claude-code adapter.json SDLC
  agent entries) — candidates to upstream as PRs to codejunkie99.

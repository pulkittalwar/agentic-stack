> **One brain, many harnesses.** A portable `.agent/` folder (memory + skills

> OpenClient, Hermes, or a DIY Python loop — and keeps its knowledge when
> you switch.

## What this is

Every guide shows the folder structure. This repo gives you the folder
structure **plus the files that actually go inside** — a working portable
brain with five seed skills, four memory layers, enforced permissions, a
nightly dream cycle, and adapters for seven harnesses.

- **Memory** — `working/`, `episodic/`, `semantic/`, `personal/`. Each
  layer has its own retention policy. Salience-scored retrieval; nightly
  compression.
- **Skills** — progressive disclosure. A lightweight manifest always loads;
  full `SKILL.md` files only load when triggers match the task. Every
  skill ships with a self-rewrite hook.
- **Protocols** — typed tool schemas, a `permissions.md` that the
  pre-tool-call hook enforces, and a delegation contract for sub-agents.

## Quickstart

```bash
# tap + install (one-time)
brew tap codejunkie99/agentic-stack https://github.com/codejunkie99/agentic-stack
brew install agentic-stack

# drop the brain into any project
cd your-project
agentic-stack claude-code
# or: cursor | windsurf | opencode | openclient | hermes | standalone-python
```

Then customize `.agent/memory/personal/PREFERENCES.md` with your own
conventions — that's the one file every user should edit on day one.

> **Clone instead?**
> ```bash
> git clone https://github.com/codejunkie99/agentic-stack.git
> cd agentic-stack && ./install.sh claude-code
> ```

## Supported harnesses

| Harness | Config file it reads | Hook support |
|---|---|---|
| **Claude Code** | `CLAUDE.md` + `.claude/settings.json` | yes (PostToolUse, Stop) |
| **Cursor** | `.cursor/rules/*.mdc` | no (manual reflect calls) |
| **Windsurf** | `.windsurfrules` | no (manual reflect calls) |
| **OpenCode** | `AGENTS.md` + `opencode.json` | partial (permission rules) |
| **OpenClient** | system-prompt include | varies by fork |
| **Hermes Agent** | `AGENTS.md` (agentskills.io compatible) | partial (own memory) |
| **Standalone Python** | `run.py` (any LLM) | yes (full control) |

## Seed skills

- **skillforge** — creates new skills from recurring patterns
- **memory-manager** — runs reflection cycles, promotes lessons
- **git-proxy** — all git ops, with safety constraints
- **debug-investigator** — reproduce → isolate → hypothesize → verify
- **deploy-checklist** — the fence between staging and production

## How it compounds

1. Skills log every action to episodic memory.
2. `memory-manager` detects recurring patterns, promotes them to semantic.
3. `on_failure` flags skills that fail 3+ times in 14 days for rewrite.
4. Self-rewrite hooks on each skill update `KNOWLEDGE.md` conservatively.
5. `git log .agent/memory/` becomes the agent's autobiography.

See [`docs/architecture.md`](docs/architecture.md) for the full picture.

## Run the dream cycle nightly

```bash
crontab -e
0 3 * * * python3 /path/to/project/.agent/memory/auto_dream.py >> /path/to/project/.agent/memory/dream.log 2>&1
```

`auto_dream.py` resolves its own paths absolutely, so no `cd` is needed — cron runs it correctly regardless of working directory.

the agent-engineering community. Built with the hypothesis that
**harness-agnosticism is the point**.
